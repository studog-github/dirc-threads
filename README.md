# dirc-threads
Adds thread links to posts in the Boards.

I always clicked the post, then the "Read Full Thread" link, which is *more*
load on the DIRC server than just going to the full thread directly. This
extension adds a thread link beside the post allowing direct navigation to the
thread and lowering the load on the server.

This extension also includes some niceties:

The message URL is added into the browser history making the browser consider
the message itself to have been visited. This mimics what normally happens under
the click post, click thread flow.

The target message is scrolled so it's in view. This really helps when
re-entering a long thread. Combined with the above history manipulation, you
know exactly where you are.
